This page lists individuals and groups who have (or have had) specific roles, but this short list is not meant to diminish the contributions of the broader community of people and companies developing software systems that use SBML. People's involvements also change over time, and we try to keep this page updated to stay current with the SBML community.

## SBML Editors and SBML Coordinator

The SBML Editors are devoted experts who develop specifications, correct errata, assess proposals, and manage revisions to SBML. The five Editors are elected by the SBML community and serve for three-year terms as volunteers.  One of the Editors is nominated by the other Editors to be Coordinator and lead activities such as organizing and chairing Editor meetings, monitoring progress on new SBML developments, and managing community votes.
